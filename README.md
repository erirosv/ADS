This repo contains code for assignments and project during my studies for my masters in *Applied Data Science*.

NOTE: Only the coding parts are provided in this repo, and also not all classes hence there are not rrelated for the coding it self.

## Information
There are projects of differnet types, from introcuction courses, to statistics and ML courses.

TIA125 Is not as technical, but it provides an understanding of how data "in the wild" are used and how different cultures can look at the same data but have different conclusions.
