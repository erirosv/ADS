    "The type of decision tree that would describe this data well is a decision tree for regression, which is used for data sets where the target variable Y is of continous value (numeric) and not discrete (categorical) where we'd use a decision tree for classification instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result seems to make sense since the natural split, when plotting the data in a scatter plot, is just around 1 on the x-axis and from the plotted tree we can see that the threshold of the feature is also approximately 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the data points are above the threshold the model will predict a y-value of approximately 1 which seems to corresponds well to an average of  where the upper right cluster is positioned on the y-axis. Likewise we can see that if the data points are below the threshold they are predicted a y-value of around 0, which also corresponds to where the lower left cluster i spositioned on the y-axis on average.\n",

    "Ideally we'd like to have a minimum value for our evaluation score (minimum mean square error). As seen in the graph for the test data we found that score at a max depth of 6. However, the green line continues to decrease as the max depth of the tree increases while the blue line does the opposite.  The behaviour of the green line can be explained by that the models starts to memorize the training data and start to overfit when the maximum depth of the tree growns larger. "
