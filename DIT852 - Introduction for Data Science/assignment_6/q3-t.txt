There are some limitations when it comes to personality test. One of the limitations are how the data has been collected. In other words the researcher can't go back after the collected the data. The big limitation of the algorithm is limited by old portraits that constrains the validation (L, Safra, C, Chevallier, J,Gr√®zes & N, Baumard, 2020).

An other problem is that they have only used pictures of convicted criminals. This give the algorithm the possibility to predict a person that any of the jury would pick (X, Wu & X, Zhang, 2016).

An ethical problem with algorithm training is get the algorithm to understand what's a acceptable an non-acceptable output, when training on a dataset of different criminal faces. An other problem is that the non-criminal pictures have been posted on the company website before (X, Wu & X, Zhang, 2016).
