In the Fragile Families Challenge researchers from 160 teams were tasked to predict a number of social outcomes -  child grade point average, child grit, household eviction, household material hardship, primary caregiver layoff, and primary caregiver participation in job training - using extensive longitudinal data. Is this a difficult prediction task? Why? Why not?

Yes, because social outcomes depends on many parameters. Many of which may not be captured well by the dataset

8:
The authors of the Fragile Families Challenge study argue that 'predictibility' is poor measure for understanding the mechanisms of social outcomes. What alternatives do the authors propose?

The current understanding is correct but incomplete because it lacks theories that explain why outcomes are dicult to predict even with high-quality data.

9:
What important ethical implications may a poor 'predictibility' of social outcomes have?

Using predictive modeling in the child-protective services may lead to wrongful removal of children from their families.

10:
What reasons can lead to unfair and unethical AI and Data Science models and algorithms?

Systemic bias in society
