## Part 5
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in NLP that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, and dates, in text. Some possible applications of NER are:
- Information extraction: NER can be used to extract important information from text, such as names of individuals, organizations, locations, and dates, to build knowledge bases, databases, or to perform further analysis.
- Sentiment analysis: By identifying named entities, NER can be used to determine the sentiment expressed towards a particular entity in text, such as a person, organization, or product, which can be useful in marketing and advertising.
- Event extraction: NER can be used to extract information about events such as location, date, and participants, to build event databases, news summaries, or to analyze public opinion.


Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging is a task in NLP that involves identifying and labeling words in text with their appropriate parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Some possible applications of POS Tagging are:
- Sentiment analysis: By identifying the parts of speech in text, POS Tagging can be used to analyze the sentiment expressed in text, as different parts of speech may carry different sentiment implications.
- Text summarization: POS Tagging can be used to identify important words and phrases in text, such as nouns and adjectives, which can then be used to generate a summary of the text.
- Word sense disambiguation: By identifying the parts of speech in text, POS Tagging can be used to disambiguate words with multiple meanings, such as homonyms, by choosing the appropriate sense based on the context in which the word appears.


Text classification is a task in NLP that involves assigning a label or category to a given text document. Some possible applications of text classification are:
- Spam filtering: Text classification can be used to classify email messages as spam or not spam, to filter unwanted messages from the inbox.
- News classification: Text classification can be used to classify news articles into different categories, such as sports, politics, technology, etc., to help users filter news that they are interested in.
- Sentiment analysis: Text classification can be used to classify the sentiment expressed in text, such as positive, negative, or neutral, to determine the overall public opinion towards a particular topic or entity.
