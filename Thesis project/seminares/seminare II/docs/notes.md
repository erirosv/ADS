# Feedback Seminar II

I am aware not all sections are compelte, the feedback for the none complete sections are there just to make it easier for the readerr who do not have any prior knowledge.

SOme general notes:
- Tables have no name and caption. You mention to see Table 1. I assumed it was the first table. 

## Introduction
You describe MAD as a new tool. However, you you do not mention any tools/approaches used before. Maybe a short background part to give the reader more context of how it was executed before andt today?

### First paragraph:
It is a good flow and introduces the concepts, and uses good exaples. 

### Second paragraph:
You mention that the data is retrived from phone users. However, you do not mention anything else regarding the etich until chapter 3.1. 

I had to jump in the text to read the ethics part before continue reading the introduction. Is it possible to mention that all user-data was collected with consent?

The OD matrix is introduces. How does it work? how does it look? A short descriprion and a figure to make it easier for the reader to understand.

### Third paragraph:
Good general descrription of the study. Once again the data is mentioned, but no mention of the consent part.

## Related Works

### Understanding mobility using big geolocation data
Good description of what has beed done before. However, you still mentioned the OD matrix with do explonation of how it works. 

You mention different angles/perspectives regarding the area, I like it a lot. 

One sentence which were outside the flow: "The above mentioned papers", maybe change it to "The papers mentioned above" for a nicer flow?

What is the four step model? 

### Activity plans from big geolocation data
You begini with a connection back to the prior text. Really nice.

The second paragraph does contain a lot of information. Maybe a small table to helt summarize the models? Maybe a bit more explonation regarding the models?

#### Routine activities at home and work
