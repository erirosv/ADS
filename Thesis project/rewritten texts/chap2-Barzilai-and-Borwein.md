The Barzilai and Borwein (BB) algorithm is a gradient descent optimization algorithm that is especially useful for optimizing non-quadratic or non-convex functions. It uses a non-monotone line search to determine the step size, which is chosen to minimize the quadratic function. The step size is inversely proportional to the dot product of the difference between the solution vectors and the difference between the gradient estimates. The algorithm iteratively updates the solution vector x by using the estimated gradient g and the non-monotone step size that takes into account the past few iterations of the algorithm.

**SEE STEPS IN OVERLEAF**

To apply the BB algorithm, we must first initialize the algorithm by choosing an initial point x0, a step size α0, and a tolerance ε > 0. Then, we compute the gradient gk of the function f at the current point xk and compute the next iterate xk+1 by the formula. We compute the step size αk+1 using the Barzilai-Borwein formula and, if |gk+1| < ε, stop the algorithm and return xk+1 as the solution. Otherwise, we set k = k + 1 and repeat from Step 2.

Note that the choice of the initial point, the search directions, and the stopping criterion are problem-dependent and may require some trial and error. The BB algorithm is usually applied to unconstrained optimization problems and may require some modifications for constrained problems. The algorithm has been shown to have fast convergence rates and good numerical stability properties in practice.

The Barzilai and Borwein method can also be applied to non-linear optimization problems by approximating the Hessian with a suitable matrix. However, the convergence properties of the method are not as well understood in the non-linear case. To update the solution vector x, we use the following update rule. The step size βk is computed as a non-monotone gain sequence that is typically chosen to satisfy certain conditions, and it allows the algorithm to escape from local minima and find better solutions.

**IGNORE SUMMARY**
In summary, the BB algorithm is an effective method for minimizing non-convex, ill-conditioned functions. It uses a non-monotone line search to determine the step size, which is chosen to minimize the quadratic function. The step size is inversely proportional to the dot product of the difference between the solution vectors and the difference between the gradient estimates. The algorithm iteratively updates the solution vector x by using the estimated gradient g and the non-monotone step size that takes into account the past few iterations of the algorithm. The choice of the initial point, the search directions, and the stopping criterion are problem-dependent and may require some trial and error. The BB algorithm can also be applied to non-linear optimization problems by approximating the Hessian with a suitable matrix.
